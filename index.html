    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I have 10 years of professional experience in software
      development, mostly in backend using C# .NET. I have used VB/C#.NET to
      perform software updates to financial systems at Mantech. I worked mainly
      with SQL Server databases, TFS, Git, Window Forms and WPF. On one project
      I used frontend skills such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Cordova, jQuery
      mobile and other 3rd party libraries to make updates to a hybrid mobile
      application for about a year. At Envoy Consulting, I used VB.NET and SQL
      Server for ETL development to create new or modify existing parsers that
      extract data from invoices. Other languages such as Java, C++ and Python I
      used for school purposes only.
